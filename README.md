I recently began learning Python, since I figured it would help me improve myself as a programmer, and now I think I am ready to take on my first "real" Python project!
This application uses the discord.py API to communicate with other Discord users and perform simple tasks. As time goes on, I will implement more and more features into the bot, not just to showcase the things I have learned, but also to continue learning what I can and can't do with this incredible language.
