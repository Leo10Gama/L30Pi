I recently began learning Python, since I figured it would help me improve myself as a programmer, and now I think I am ready to take on my first "real" Python project!
This application uses the discord.py API to communicate with other Discord users and perform simple tasks. As time goes on, I will implement more and more features into the bot, not just to showcase the things I have learned, but also to continue learning what I can and can't do with this incredible language.

Please note that the Discord token is hidden in a .env file on my personal computer to prevent people from 'hacking into my bot' with malicious intent. The .env file simply contains the Discord Token that acts as the bot's password
